## Overview
This project is a terminal-based **Battleship Game**. We decided to utilize the **Facade Design Pattern** to create our program's overall structure. This pattern allowed for modularization- simplifying the interaction between the main driver, the application (high-level interface), the game boards (game logic), and the ships.
